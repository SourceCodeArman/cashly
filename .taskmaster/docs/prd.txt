# Overview  
Cashly is a comprehensive personal finance management application designed to help young adults and professionals take control of their financial lives through automated tracking, intelligent categorization, and goal-oriented savings. The app addresses the common problem of financial disorganization and lack of visibility into spending patterns, which prevents users from making informed financial decisions and achieving their savings goals.

The modern financial landscape is complex, with individuals managing multiple bank accounts, credit cards, and financial goals simultaneously. Traditional budgeting methods require manual entry, are time-consuming, and often fall by the wayside. Cashly solves this by automatically aggregating financial data from multiple sources, categorizing transactions intelligently, and providing actionable insights that help users understand their spending habits and achieve their financial objectives.

Cashly's value proposition centers on three core pillars: automation, intelligence, and simplicity. By eliminating manual data entry through bank account integration, providing smart categorization and insights through machine learning, and presenting financial information in an intuitive, easy-to-understand interface, Cashly empowers users to make better financial decisions without the cognitive overhead of traditional budgeting tools.

# Core Features  

## Bank Account and Card Integration
Cashly connects to users' bank accounts and credit cards through secure API integrations with financial data aggregators (e.g., Plaid, Yodlee, or similar services). This enables automatic transaction synchronization, eliminating the need for manual entry. The integration supports multiple account types including checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, and investment accounts. Real-time transaction updates ensure users always have the most current view of their financial status.

This feature is critical because manual transaction entry is the primary reason users abandon budgeting apps. Automation removes friction and ensures data accuracy, making financial tracking a passive activity rather than an active chore.

## Automatic Transaction Tracking
Every transaction from connected accounts is automatically imported and categorized. The system tracks transaction amounts, dates, merchants, and locations. Transactions are processed in near real-time, with push notifications for significant transactions or unusual spending patterns. Users can review, edit, or recategorize transactions as needed, and the system learns from user corrections to improve future categorization accuracy.

This feature provides the foundation for all other Cashly functionality. Without accurate, up-to-date transaction data, budgeting, insights, and goal tracking become unreliable and ineffective.

## Expense and Income Categorization
Cashly automatically categorizes transactions into predefined categories (e.g., groceries, dining out, transportation, utilities, entertainment) using merchant information, transaction patterns, and machine learning algorithms. Users can create custom categories, set up category rules, and manually adjust categorizations. The system supports subcategories and tags for granular tracking. Income sources are separately tracked and categorized (salary, freelance, investments, etc.).

Intelligent categorization reduces user effort while providing the detailed insights necessary for effective budgeting. It enables users to understand where their money goes without spending time organizing transactions manually.

## Smart Savings Goals
Users can create multiple savings goals with target amounts and deadlines. Cashly calculates recommended monthly contributions based on goals and current spending patterns. The app supports various goal types including emergency funds, vacations, major purchases, and debt payoff. Users can set up automatic transfers or receive reminders to contribute manually. Progress tracking includes visual indicators, milestone celebrations, and predictive analytics showing if goals are on track based on current savings rates.

Savings goals transform abstract financial aspirations into concrete, achievable targets. By automating recommendations and tracking progress, Cashly helps users build wealth systematically rather than saving whatever is left over at the end of the month.

## Spending Insights and Analytics
Cashly provides comprehensive analytics including spending trends over time, category breakdowns, comparison periods (month-over-month, year-over-year), and predictive spending forecasts. Interactive charts and graphs visualize financial data, making patterns easy to identify. The app highlights unusual spending, identifies recurring subscriptions, and provides recommendations for reducing expenses. Budget vs. actual analysis shows how spending compares to planned budgets.

Analytics transform raw transaction data into actionable insights. By surfacing spending patterns and trends, users can identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions about their financial habits.

## Secure Authentication and Data Protection
Cashly implements bank-level security including multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometric login (fingerprint, face ID), end-to-end encryption for sensitive data, and secure token-based API connections. User credentials are never stored locally or transmitted insecurely. The app complies with financial data protection regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR) and uses industry-standard security practices including regular security audits and penetration testing.

Security is non-negotiable for financial applications. Users must trust that their sensitive financial data is protected with the highest levels of security to feel comfortable using the platform.

# User Experience  

## User Personas

### Primary Persona: Sarah, the Busy Professional
Sarah is a 28-year-old marketing manager earning $65,000 annually. She has a checking account, a savings account, and two credit cards. Sarah wants to save $10,000 for a down payment on a house within two years, but she struggles to understand where her money goes each month.

# Technical Architecture  

## System Components

### Frontend Application
The Cashly frontend is built as a responsive web application with mobile-first design, supporting iOS, Android, and web browsers. The application uses a modern JavaScript framework (React or React Native for cross-platform mobile development) with a state management solution (Redux or Zustand) for handling complex application state. The UI component library ensures consistency across platforms while allowing platform-specific optimizations.

The frontend communicates with backend services through a RESTful API, with WebSocket connections for real-time transaction updates. Client-side encryption ensures sensitive data is protected before transmission. The application implements offline functionality, allowing users to view cached data when connectivity is limited.

### Admin Portal
A separate but integrated Admin Dashboard (`AdminDashboard.tsx`) provides system oversight, log viewing, user management, and API analytics.

### Backend Services
The Cashly backend is built using a microservices architecture, enabling scalability and maintainability. Core services include:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, login, password management, and multi-factor authentication. Integrates with OAuth providers and implements JWT-based session management.

- **Account Aggregation Service**: Manages connections to financial data providers (e.g., Plaid, Yodlee). Handles OAuth flows, token refresh, and account synchronization. Processes webhooks for real-time transaction updates.

- **Transaction Processing Service**: Ingests transaction data from aggregation services, normalizes transaction formats, and applies categorization rules. Implements **Google Gemini AI** for advanced automatic categorization and anomaly detection (see `GEMINI_SETUP.md`).

- **Analytics Service**: Generates spending insights, trends, and forecasts. Processes large volumes of transaction data to produce aggregated analytics and recommendations. Implements caching for frequently accessed analytics.

- **Goals Service**: Manages savings goals, calculates contribution recommendations, tracks progress, and triggers notifications for milestones. Integrates with budgeting logic to balance goal contributions with spending needs.

- **Notification Service**: Sends push notifications, emails, and in-app notifications for transaction alerts, goal milestones, spending insights, and system updates. Supports user notification preferences and delivery channels.

### Data Storage
Cashly uses a combination of relational and non-relational databases:

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for structured data including user accounts, transactions, categories, goals, and budgets. Supports ACID transactions and complex queries for analytics.

- **Redis**: Caching layer for frequently accessed data (user sessions, account balances, recent transactions) and real-time data (WebSocket connections, rate limiting).

- **Data Warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery)**: Long-term storage for analytics and reporting. Enables complex analytical queries on historical transaction data without impacting primary database performance.

- **Object Storage (e.g., S3)**: Stores user-uploaded documents, receipts, and backup data. Implements versioning and lifecycle policies for cost optimization.

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Financial Data Aggregators**: Plaid, Yodlee, or similar services for bank account connectivity. These services handle the complexity of connecting to thousands of financial institutions while maintaining security and compliance.

- **Payment Processors**: Stripe or similar for processing subscription payments (if Cashly offers premium features). Handles payment methods, subscriptions, and billing.

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for hosting services, databases, and storage. Implements auto-scaling, load balancing, and disaster recovery.

- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Services like Datadog, New Relic, or similar for application monitoring, error tracking, and performance analytics. Ensures system reliability and helps identify issues proactively.
